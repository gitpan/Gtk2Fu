Gtk2Fu

gtk2-fu is a layer on top of perl gtk2, that brings power, simplicity and speed
of development. It brings additional methods to ease the widget creation among
other things. But the most important feature is that it brings you a lot of
derivated methods from existing methods, that does exactly the same thing,
except that ir returns the widget.

See the POD for more information on the module.

Gtk2Fu requires perl-gtk2. It detects at run-time if perl-Gnome2 is available.
